  - This project has been tested doing the following;

  - Copied and ran code through PEP8
  - Tested all game input values and that they returned the corisponding warning texts
  - Tested on a laptop and a desktop terminal
  - Family tested on the Heroku display console


# Bugs
  - Code was orriginaly commited and pushed through VSCode on mac in another repository.[BattleShip2.0](https://github.com/bslevin/BattleShip2.0/commits/main)
      - When loading it into Heroku an apple.error came back. 
      - I then subsequently copied and pasted the code to this repository using gitpod. 
      - In this version most commits are for the read me.
